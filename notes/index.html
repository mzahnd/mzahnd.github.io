        This is what I write down in a random piece of paper, a napkin, or 
        <a href="https://joplinapp.org" target="_blank">Joplin</a> while learning something 
        completely new, doing something I've never done before or trying to reduce my number of 
        (repeated) queries into web search engines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of them are older than this website, some are written with more detail, some are
        nothing but the absolute minimum number of words needed to be read by myself of someone
        who is looking for *that* command (s)he came across some time ago.
    </p>

    {% for note in all_notes %}

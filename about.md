# Hi!

My name is Martín [^acute-accent]. I'm a 23 year old computer engineering 
student from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I started this website on mid-2021 mainly to learn about web development 
[^web-development] and practice a little bit my english writting. I also wanted
to keep record of my learning process in general by posting notes and blog
entries about anything interesting I'm trying to comprehend.

You can check my [LinkedIn profile][lk-profile] and 
[GitHub account][gh-account] or, even better, [Contact Me][contact-link].

The source code of this website is available in 
[this GitHub repository][gh-fugazzeta-repo]

[^acute-accent]:
    *With* an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent),
    please.

[^web-development]:
    I'll publish a few posts and notes about how I built this site and my
    learning process for doing so.
